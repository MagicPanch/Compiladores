# 🛠️ Homemade Java Compiler

This project is a **homemade compiler written in Java**, designed to implement **all major stages of the compilation process**:  
- **Lexical Analysis**  
- **Syntax Analysis**  
- **Semantic Analysis**  
- **Code Generation** (to assembler)

The project was developed as a way to deeply understand how compilers work internally by building one from the ground up using Java as the main programming language.

---

## ⚙️ Features

- ✅ Full pipeline from source code to assembler
- ✅ Lexical, syntactic, and semantic checks
- ✅ Generation of low-level assembler-like code
- ✅ Inspired by the **Java compiler's behavior** and structure
- ✅ Extensive testing with **complex input programs**
- ✅ Clear and complete technical **documentation and reports**

---

## 🧪 Testing

The compiler was tested with a wide variety of programs, from simple expressions to more advanced control flow structures and recursive functions. These test cases allowed us to validate the correctness and robustness of the compiler, and to refine its behavior to match expected outcomes.

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used

A range of tools and technologies were used to support the development, including components similar to **YACC** for parser generation. However, the core logic and structure remain handcrafted in Java, emphasizing educational value and full control over the compilation process.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Simulate key behaviors of a **real-world compiler** like Java's
- Gain hands-on experience with **compiler design patterns**
- Explore the challenges of translating high-level code to low-level instructions
- Provide well-structured **reports as documentation** of each stage

---

## 📄 Documentation

Comprehensive reports were created throughout the development process. These documents serve as technical documentation and include:

- Design decisions
- Implementation details
- Grammar definitions
- Semantic rules
- Test results
- Code generation examples

## 🚀 Getting Started

> _This project was built as a learning tool and a technical deep-dive into compiler construction. If you're interested in understanding how source code turns into executable instructions, this project offers a practical and insightful reference._
